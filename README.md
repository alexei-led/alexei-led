## Hey 👋

I've spent 25 years building software — from bare metal to Kubernetes to whatever comes next.

Started with chaos engineering and containers. Built [Pumba](https://github.com/alexei-led/pumba) to break things in production on purpose. Then Docker, Kubernetes, cloud architecture — the usual path of someone who enjoys watching systems fail gracefully.

These days I'm deep into **AI agents and infrastructure** — building bridges between LLMs and the real world:

- [**k8s-mcp-server**](https://github.com/alexei-led/k8s-mcp-server) — AI assistants that actually talk to your cluster (kubectl, helm, istio, argo)
- [**aws-mcp-server**](https://github.com/alexei-led/aws-mcp-server) — same idea, but for AWS CLI, sandboxed
- [**spotinfo**](https://github.com/alexei-led/spotinfo) — because Spot pricing shouldn't be a mystery

The shift from "I write code" to "I orchestrate agents that write code" happened faster than anyone expected. Not sure if that's exciting or terrifying. Probably both.

`Go` · `Python` · `Kubernetes` · `AWS` · `MCP` · `AI Agents`

<sub>Opinions are my own. Code is open source. Future is uncertain.</sub>
